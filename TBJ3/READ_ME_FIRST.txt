TOY BOX JAM 3 -- READ ME FIRST!

Last year, recently resurfaced recluse game developer Max Tojoby shared his unfinished early AX-JOY TOMB prototype, filled with secrets....

This year, he sent a bizarre message and some files... what to make of it all?


DEAR TOY BOX JAMMERS,

I really enjoyed your creations last year.  So much so, that I thought I would share some more with you!

I worked on a game called CAPTAIN NEAT-O, a young sci-fi hero that has adventures in space. He has one stripe on his helmet, not to be confused with other character.

Anyway, I've included small and large sprites of that character that might be fun to use!

Also, there are some other files on this disk.... wonder what they could contain....

Have fun.

Peace,
M.T.

On the disk are three carts of starting assets, as well some strange files: password-protected ZIPs, some weird text files, some kind of map(?), and other strange files. Maybe some Toy Boy Jammer can figure them out and get more assets to use!

Good luck, brave jammers!

Sincerely,
The TOY BOX JAM Organizers
